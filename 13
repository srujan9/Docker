Use case
Start redis:3.0.6 as a service in docker swarm with 3 replicas
and upgrade the version to 3.0.7.
Check if the upgrade has effected all the containers on manager
and worker nodes

 docker service create --replicas 3 --name mydb redis:3.0.6

To update it ot 3.0.7
docker service update --image redis:3.0.7 mydb
docker service ps mydb

To rollback redis version
docker service update --rollback mydb
docker service ps mydb

To remove a service from docker swarm
docker service rm mydb


Draining a worker
===================
The manager can remove a worker from the docker swarm so that it cannot take any further swarm requests
docker node update --availabilty drain worker1

To reactivate the worker
docker node update --availablity active worker1

For a worker to leave the swarm
docker swarm leave

For manager to leave the swarm
docker swarm leave --force
