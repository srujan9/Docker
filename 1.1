Docker
=============
It is a platform for implementing containaraization

Virtualization
=================
In virtualization we have a bare metal(H/w) on which we install our host os.on this host os we install hypervisor(vmware ,oracle virtual box etc).On the hypervisor we install our guest os
and on these guest os we can install our applications.The disadvantage of the above is architecture
is the applications running on guest os has to pass through multiple layers in order to access
the hardware resources.This will result in downgraded performance of the applications

Containers
===============
In docker we have a bare metal on which host os is installed and on the host machine
we install a s/w called docker engine.on the docker engine we can install any number 
of docker containers.These containers are not allocated any fixed amount of hardware
resources.When the containers are running docker engine decides how much hardware should
be allocated for each container depending on the processes running in the container

Docker performs process isolation and enbles it to run seperately in userspace
without bothering about the underlying hardware and os.


Installing docker on linux
============================
1 open http://get.docker.com
2 Copy the first 2 commands and paste them in a linux terminal
    curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    sh get-docker.sh

3 To check the version of docker running on our machine
    docker --version

Installing docker on windows
==============================
1 Open https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms
2 Go to desktops section
3 Install docker for windows

Note:docker for windows activates an application called HperV.If this hyperv is active it will not allow any virtaulization software to run(vmware,oracle virtual box)
