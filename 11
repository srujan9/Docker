Create 2 networks intelliq1 and intelliq2
Create 3 busybox containers c,c2 and c3
c1 and c2 should run on intelliq1 network so they will be able to ping each other
c3 should be created on intelliq2 network and it shoule not be able to ping to c1 andc2
Now connect c2 to intelliq2 network..ie c2 is running on both intelliq1 and intelliq2 networks
c2 should be able to ping to c1 and c3 but c1 should not be bale to ping to c3

docker network create intelliq1
docker network create intelliq2
docker run --name c1 -it --network intelliq1 busybox
Come out of c1 container without exit(Ctrl + p,ctrl+q)
docker run --name c2 -it --network intelliq1 busybox
In c2 container
 ping ipadress-of-c1-container :It should ping
Come out of c2 container without exit(Ctrl + p,ctrl+q)
docker run --name c3 -it --network intelliq2 busybox
In c3 container
  ping padress-of-c1-container :It should not ping
  ping padress-of-c2-container :It should not ping
docker network connect intelliq2 c2
docker attach c2
In c2 container
 ping ipadress-of-c1-container :It should ping
 ping ipadress-of-c3-container :It should ping





DockerSwarm
This is a feature of docker using which we can perform container
orchestration.In a scenario where we want ot run run 100's of containers
in a distributed network on multiple docker hosts we can use docker swarm
Advantages
---------
1 We can launch fixed no of container for a single docker image
2 Perform health checks on containers
3 Auto scalling of the containers ie icreasing or decreasing the no of
  containers for a specific service
4 Performing rolling updates
5 Start or stop services on multiple containers

Setup of Docker swarm
1 Create 3 linux vm's and install docker on all of them
2 Name the 1st machine as manager and the other 2 as worker1 and worker2
3 Go to the manager machine and create a docker swarm
  Capture the ip adress of this machine

   docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.62.100

4 In the output of the above command it will display the command to join a worker to the docker swarm

5 Copy that command and paste it in worker1 and worker2

3 To find the list of machines running in docker swarm
  docker node ls

Creating services in docker swarm
======================================
1 Create an nginx service running on 5 containers
   docker service create --replicas 5  -p 8080:80 --name webserver nginx

2 To find the list of docker hosts on which the above service is running
  docker service ps webserver

3 We will be able to open the same nginx thorugh the ipadrees
  of the manger or worker1 or worker2
  http:192.168.62.100:8080
  http:192.168.62.200:8080
  http:10.10.10.10:8080

4 To scale the contianers up or down ie increase the no of container
  or decrease the no of containers
  docker service scale webserver=8
